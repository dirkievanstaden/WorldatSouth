	 &nbsp&nbsp"According to a very old man, the first account of melodic lyricism was around the time of the big bang when the expansion of the universe 
	 &nbsp&nbspcreated a sound so loud and romantic, it had to be considered musical. Experience a sound explosion of similar proportions with a ticket to 
	 &nbsp&nbspDigaritmo at the Dorpstraat Theatre."
